				 	Sometimes I really don't know what to do with my Uncle Alberic, he's such a weirdo. Just between you and me, he must have a nut or a bolt missing somewhere. Otherwise how could his brains be so screwed up the way they are? Grown-ups don't exactly bowl me over with their preposterous shenanigans.

As he does every Saturday afternoon, Unky Berky (the pet name for Uncle in French is tonton, but he doesn't like me to call him like that, coz if I pronounce it Yankee style, it sounds as if he weighed not one but two tons, though when he drives me up the wall, that's what he deserves) came to fetch me to go for a stroll in the park. This time, though, it was raining cats and dogs as they say. To me, it felt more like all the cows of the Loire Valley and Normandy had gathered in the sky like hot-air balloons to march against the capital, and decided instead, all together, to take a leak over our heads.

Unky Berky kept saying it was good for the farmers. Did he ask which the snails preferred, to drown in megapuddles by the thousands, or get sucked boiled with garlic sauce, and end up in French stomachs, maybe next to some poor frogs' legs or melted goat cheese?

We were walking, both wrapped up like those nerds that go visit Niagara Falls, he in his khaki oil-skin - it now looks more like faded caca really - and me in my K-way coveralls. Then all of a sudden, he began to run in front of me, yelling in his funny English: "Esmeraaalda, darlinggg, I have to go in ze bush, it is pressinggg, wait for me pleeez!"

When he knows people are listening, he loves to stress my name so that everyone thinks he is talking to some princess.

In the beginning I believed he would really go behind a tree and pee like dogs do, but bush to him means the men's room. He also thinks he can scream his head off when he speaks English as if I had suddenly become hard of hearing. I know why he does that: he feels more free coz it's not his native tongue. But he forgets that in the park there are other English speakers, American mothers with their kids, or with Anglo au pair girls pushing the prams of rich French brats.

So of course, people turn around to stare at us. That's when I want to squash his face, which is pinkish red and reminds me of a lobster Newburg. Boy do I love lobsters! if they weren't so expensive, I'd eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with no dressing. But seeing the way they toss and turn in those water tanks you see in all the posh sea-food restaurants here in Paris, gives me the creeps. I wouldn't want to be shrunk like in the movie, finding myself caught between their horribly exaggerated pincers. The bozo who had the original idea of exposing these megacritters alive in front of waiting and hungry customers as if they were just harmless goldfish ought to be horsewhipped. If he's dead, may he be chased after by a million garglesaurs.

Once, as he was performing again, shouting "ze bush" at the top of his lungs, Unky Berky scared the wits out of an old granny who kept saying: "Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu, I hope he didn't hurt that poor little girl. There are such monsters roaming around. Maybe I should call the warden."

She came up ttte. Actually I don't mind it at all, as long as it stays betwee
